1. What is this referring to? Think programming-wise rather than in the terms of the game.
   This refers to how to use code (functions) to control the character (the object)
   
2. What does the () do in JavaScript?
   Inside of () can be parameters passed into a function, or could be an expression (e.g x == 2)
   In this program, nothing is inside () so what it does is simply calling the function

   The semicolon tells the compiler that a single script has ended so that it is separated from the next script
