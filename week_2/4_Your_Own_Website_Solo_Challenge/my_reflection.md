# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://quytx1102.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
===========================================================================================================
* This week I have learned how to separate HTML structure and CSS, and gained a lot of experience in designing.
* I like designing websites so that user has the best experience possible (fun, responsive websites, great look, etc.) It was a lot of fun!! But time consuming as well, because I have to look up for syntax most of the time. I believe this will only get better and better. 
* One difficulty I had is scaling images. I wanted to make my header image fits the brower's width and the height will be auto-scaled so that the image maintains its ratio; however at the moment I haven't figure out a way to do this yet. I don't know if there is anyway that we can retrieve the browser's current width and set the image's height based on that value?
* Next I'll try to add several frames and re-organize the images. Also I might add some content.
* It was not difficult applying what I have learned. What was difficult is, how to design the web and break it down into smaller and smaller tasks.
* I found that there are a lot of tutorial videos on youtube. Whenever I want to do a particular design task for my website, I tried to search on youtube first. Learning by watching and listening is probably much more effective than just reading. Here's one turorial that I found very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz2klMXDqF4
