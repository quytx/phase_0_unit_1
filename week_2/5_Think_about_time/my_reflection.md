# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
==============================================================================================================
* I am currently in the last 2 weeks of schools, with 4 coming final exams, 3 big projects, 3 Java programs I need to build from scratch. I am so eager to build an awesome website, but right now I do not have that much time to dig in and go crazy about it.
* I tried to spend an hour everyday for Dev Bootcamp during the weekdays, and about 5-8 hours in the weekends.
* I spent less time for lunch and dinner, take a short 5-10 mins nap everytime I feel tired and then get back to study.
* After the next 2 weeks, I will be pretty much free and will dedicate my whole time for Dev Bootcamp. My plan is to master the HTML/CSS stuff (enough to know how to do what I want) and JavaScript, as well as other materials in phase 0 so that I will be ready for the next phase.
