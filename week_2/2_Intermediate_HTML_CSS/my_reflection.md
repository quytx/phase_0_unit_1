# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
==================================================================================================================
* In my opinion, web standards are good because they help improve compatibility between devices; make it easier to re-use code or edit your code later. In general, I think almost everything that is widely used should be standardized, otherwise it would become a mess.
* I personally prefer the new HTML5 elements especially the <nav>, because it is easier to group all links together, makes it more "semantic" and also because they look better to my eyes.
* reset.css is necessary when you need to change everything back to default to avoid different looks on different browsers/or when you cannot keep track of the current style settings
* I used to use Mozilla Firefox, however I've been using Google Chrome in the last 4 years. The major reason I switched to Chrome was because of its speed and because Chrome was the first browser that allows user to type directly in the address bar to search via Google.com. I did notice the different looks on some websites between Chrome and Firefox. To me, it's not a big deal. Eventually you will get used to the browser's default style. However, if all browsers can display the same style, that would be nice.
