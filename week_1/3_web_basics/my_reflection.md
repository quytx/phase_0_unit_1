## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

=====================================================================================================
* I have learned a lot. Two of those would be the DNS along with IPv4 and IPv6 ( which I used to thought that it has something to do with the proxy), and what a web development team would be like: front end, back end, and QA engineers/PM.
 * Some important things when setting up a HTML site: creating an index.html file, put that into the directory (assuming a domain name, a hosting server with a proper DNS are already created)
 * I feel like wow, so it is not very difficult at all. Now I just need to learn how to add contents to my web page, create some applications, and then learn how to protect it!
 * These terms about web I have heard and seen so many times but I did not really understand the meaning of each, especially the DNS. Not sure if I got it all now, but I do know what they are.
 * I actually went to godaddy.com, purchased a domain name with a hosting server (they are currently having a special promotion for a domain for just $3 in the first year). I can't wait to apply what I will learned to my own website.
