## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

================================================================================================================
* To create a new repository, you need to log in to your GitHub account, click on "Create new repository", name your repository's address, adjust settings and you are done !
* Open source means users have access to both the source code and the program itself.
* I think open source is great because everyone can join, try and contribute to improve the program. No one is perfect and any program can always be imrpoved. From some point of view though, this might not make sense because you dedicated your time making a product without being paid. But, it is not neccessarily true. Firstly, you make a product that can help people, seeing other people using your product  - that will brings you true enjoyment. Secondly, even if you give it to people for free and receive no money directly,  you will be credited for your hard work and will eventually earn money from other sources (of course your work must be great too!).
* Using licenses is crucial. Nothing is free - you need to help developers in some way to encourage them to keep going on their work. Even if it is free, you still need to say thank you. Donation, published articles, etc. never hurt.
* At first, I had no idea what Git and GitHub is. I am sure I have heard about them many times, but not until now did I have a better understanding of what it does and how important it is.
* I have found some helpfull sites in foreign language (i.e. in my home country's language) and also wikipedia is always a good reference to get a general understanding.
