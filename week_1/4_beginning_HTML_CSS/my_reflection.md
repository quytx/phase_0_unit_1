## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

=====================================================================================================
* Up until now, what I've read is pretty straight-forward. 
* One thing I dont really like is that if I have a website with a large amount of text and I want to put different words/block of words in different styles, positioning them, etc. it will take a lot of time. This has nothing to do with programming (I feel that it's more like designing). Or may be I haven't learned enough?
* Yes, when I successfully linked the external .css file to the header of the webpage, I feel like "Yeahhh"!!
* For CSS, I found the www.w3schools.com is very helpful. Also http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm is a good place to check out different color codes!
