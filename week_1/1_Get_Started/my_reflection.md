## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* I had difficulty in understanding exactly how Git works. 
* To my understanding, any programming project mostly requires involvement of many team members. Git is a version control system that can keep track of each team member at any point and if something wrong happens we can always go back to the last previous stable stage. GitHub, on the other hand, is a social network that was developed based on a GIT system, writen by Ruby on Rails that provides users with both public and private repositories where team members can add/edit and keep track of their source codes together.
* Using version control in web developing makes a lot of sense to me. Programming is not an one-day job. It requires concentration and consistency of all team members for the beginning to the very end of the project. Any one can have a bad day, and mistakes are highly likely unavoidable. Version control bring us a peace of mind - we just need to focus on our work without worrying about losing previous work or making a mistake.
* At the moment I haven't completely understood how Git system works using "hash"-liket technique as well as the public SSH key, so I can say that part doesn't make sense to me, just because I dont understand it yet.
